# TOVE Paper

Codes for paper about TOVE data. Files available:

1. Preprocessing: File for aggregating all the counts temporally and by line.
2. Exploratory: Exploratory analysis of the data we will use to fit our model.

Note: Data is not available. We don't have permission for making it public so far.

However, in the folder ToyExample there is a simple way of fitting the three models we have proposed in the paper
